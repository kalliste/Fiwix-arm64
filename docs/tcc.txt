Fiwix can be built with a modified version of tcc instead of gcc.

A version of tcc which has been verified to compile Fiwix can be retrieved
(at the time of this writing) from the following URL:
https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tinycc/tcc-0.9.27.tar.bz2

Fiwix uses a linker script to specify high virtual addresses for data
structures but uses low physical addresses for the addresses to load
the kernel sections into.

tcc does not support linker scripts and so a small modification must
be applied to tcc in order to calculate the appropriate physical addresess
for sections in the ELF header.

The layout_sections function in the file tccelf.c must be modified
(around line 1674).

This line:
                        ph->p_paddr = ph->p_vaddr;

Must be changed to this:
                        ph->p_paddr = ph->p_vaddr;
                        if (s1->text_addr == 0xC0100000)
                            ph->p_paddr = ph->p_paddr - 0xC0000000;
                        if (s1->text_addr == 0x80100000)
                            ph->p_paddr = ph->p_paddr - 0x80000000;


This change is specific to Fiwix and so it is unlikely to be incorporated
into the standard tcc compiler in the future.


Note that tcc does not support certain constructs used by CONFIG_OFFSET64,
CONFIG_PRINTK64, or CONFIG_NET, so you muse undefine these options.

These commands will build Fiwix with tcc:

echo "#undef CONFIG_OFFSET64" > include/fiwix/custom_config.h
echo "#undef CONFIG_PRINTK64" >> include/fiwix/custom_config.h
make clean
make CCEXE="tcc" CONFFLAGS="-DCUSTOM_CONFIG_H"
